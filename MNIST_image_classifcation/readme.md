Project Name: MNIST Image Classification with TensorFlow and Keras
Overview
This project is a simple implementation of image classification using the MNIST dataset with TensorFlow and Keras. The MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9) and is widely used for training various image processing systems.

The goal of this project is to build and train a neural network model to recognize handwritten digits and evaluate its performance on the MNIST test dataset.

Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualization)
